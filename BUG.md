## BUG-20260611-01 — chunked request with HTTP trailers never gets a response (connection hangs)

- **Date** : 2026-06-11
- **Statut** : OPEN
- **Module touché** : `foy-chappe` / chappe transport (trailer parsing after the final chunk)
- **Symptôme** : a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request carrying trailer fields
  gets **no response at all** — the connection stays open and silent. A client
  reading the socket without `SO_TIMEOUT` blocks forever (this froze the first
  full Servlet TCK run: `HttpServletRequest40Tests.TrailerTest` stuck in
  `Socket.read()`, thread dump captured 2026-06-11).
- **Reproduction minimale** :
  ```
  ./run-official-tck-servlet6.1.sh "-Dtest=HttpServletRequest40Tests#TrailerTest"
  # or: send POST with Transfer-Encoding: chunked, a body chunk, then
  # "0\r\nmyTrailer: foo\r\n\r\n" — no bytes ever come back
  ```
- **Hypothèse de cause** : the chunked decoder does not consume/parse trailer
  fields after the terminal `0\r\n` chunk, so the request never completes and
  the dispatch never fires (or blocks reading what it thinks is more body).
  `request.getTrailerFields()` (Servlet 4.0 §) depends on the same parsing.
  Related TCK fallout: the rest of `HttpServletRequest40Tests` (10/11 errors).
- **Investigations** :
  - 2026-06-11 : found during the first full Servlet 6.1 TCK measurement run
    (see `TCK.md` §3.2 and §5). Mitigated harness-side with a JUnit global
    timeout (`junit-platform.properties`) so measurement runs cannot freeze;
    the implementation gap itself remains open. Audit hint: see the workspace
    memory of CHAPPE-004-style single-read bugs — the trailer path may be
    another "assumes everything arrives in one read()" case.
